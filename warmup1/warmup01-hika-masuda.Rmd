## Cabbage and Sausage Casserole
![cabbage and sausage casserole](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1706/24375331702_63bac31ebb_k.jpg)

Ingredients

* Salt  
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter  
* 1 pound fresh sweet Italian pork sausages or bulk sausage meat  
* 1 large green or Savoy cabbage (2 pounds), cored and thickly shredded  
* Freshly ground black pepper  
* Crusty bread and coarse mustard, for serving  

Necessary Kitchen Tools

* 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish

#### Recipe

Heat oven to 300 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and butter a 9-by-13-by-2-inch baking dish. If using sausages, remove casings and discard them.

Place cabbage in boiling water, cover, and let water come back to the boil. Uncover and boil for 3 minutes. Drain cabbage in a colander and run cold water over it to stop cooking. Drain well.

Put about 1/3 of the cabbage in buttered dish and cover with 1/2 the meat. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with butter. Repeat, ending with a final layer of cabbage, and dot top with butter.

Cover dish tightly with a layer of parchment paper (commenters who skipped the parchment said that their vegetables discolored against the foil), then top with a lid or a layer of aluminum foil. Cook for about 2 1/2 hours, until cabbage is soft and sweet, and top is lightly browned. After 2 hours, uncover the dish; if there is a lot of liquid in the bottom, leave uncovered for the rest of the cooking time. If not, re-cover and finish cooking. In our case, there was not a lot of liquid but I hoped to get a little color on the top so left it uncovered for the remaining time.

#### Other info

Even though this recipe is great all year, it's especially great in the cold months of winter when it will warm you up!
Different aromatics can be added to the casserole for extra flavor and aroma such as tomatoes, bacon bits, and herbs.

###Definition
___
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them (pq***).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (_p<sub>1</sub>_, _p<sub>2</sub>_,..., _p<sub>n</sub>_) and **q** = (_q<sub>1</sub>_, _q<sub>2</sub>_,..., _q<sub>n</sub>_) are two points in Euclidean _n_-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:
\usepackage{amsmath}
\begin{align}
d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q})=d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p}) &=\sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2+\cdots+(q_n-p_n)^2} \\
&=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i - p_i)^2}.
\end{align}

The position of a point in a Euclidean _n_-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
\begin{align}
|\mathbf{p}\|=\sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + \cdots + p_n^2}=\sqrt{\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{p}},
\end{align}

where the last expression involves the dot product.

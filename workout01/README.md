This is workout 01 for Stat 133 Spring 2019.

In this project, I take 2016 season data of five players from the Golden State Warriors (found in the code folder), and output summaries of each player's statistics (found in the output folder). In the images folder, you will find charts of the each player has taken, with the nba court in the background for reference. The code folder includes the code I wrote in R in order to create the charts and tables.

The report folder contains the report I have written about the Golden State Warriors by synthesizing the data I have compiled throughout this project.
